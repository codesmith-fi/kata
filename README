fizzbuzz
--------
A java based implementation of FizzBuzz kata.
See http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/ for info.
Includes tests (JUnit5), there is no GUI for this application.

romanNumerals
-------------
A java based implementation of Roman Numerals kata 
See http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/ for info.

Converts between Roman numeral strings and integers. Includes tests (JUnit4).
Application launches Swing based UI if no arguments are given in the command
line. With arguments the operation is different.
 Argument -r displays conversion between integer values 0-1000 and Roman numeral
 Argument -i displays conversion between set of Roman numerals and integer values

Build in 'kata/romanNumerals' folder using 'ant'
    Run the unit tests with full build
        ant test
    Run the calculator application with UI 
        ant run
    
    The application jar is placed into './release' folder in build
    See build.xml for other tasks like 'clean'
'ant test' runs the unit tests and reports are generated as xml, txt and html.
 Reports are generated to './junit' folder.

General comments
----------------
Excersices were done in TDD as much as possible. Tests were written before the
code meant to be tested. Refactoring was used when new requirements caused
changes to the design and implementation.

Written using Eclipse Photon in Linux operating system.

Algorithms are designed to be iterative, they could probably be recursive but
it was not point of this excercise. Feel free to improve the code. :-)
