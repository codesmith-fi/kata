Building projects
-----------------
Either using a IDE of your choice (e.g. Eclipse) or by using the
ant tool.
Change into subproject folder and execute
    ant release     builds and creates jar into release folder
    ant run         builds and executes the program 
    ant test        builds and executes unit tests, reports will
                    be generated into the projects junit subfolder.

I used OpenJDK 11 and ant 1.9.13. Tested on both Ubuntu Linux 18.x
and Windows 10.

General comments
----------------
Excersices were done in TDD as much as possible. Tests were written before the
code meant to be tested. Refactoring was used when new requirements caused
changes to the design and implementation.

Written using Eclipse Photon in Linux operating system. 
Tested under Java version  8 (OpenJDK8).

Algorithms are designed to be iterative, they could probably be recursive but
it was not point of this excercise. Feel free to improve the code. :-)
