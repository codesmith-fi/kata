Description:
------------
Implement a program which goes through numbers from 1 to 100 and prints
either Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz or the number itself depending if it is 
divisible by three, five, both or neither OR contains a character "3" or 5.

Usage:
- Check numbers 1 to 100
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar
- Check a certain number
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar {number}
  e.g. 
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar 1	Result "1"
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar 13	Result "Fizz"
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar 53	Result "FizzBuzz"
	java -jar fizzbuzz.jar 51	Result "Buzz"

Solution:
---------
Project implemented using Eclipse IDE (Photon) and the tests done JUnit
Jupiter.

Project was done using TDD so the tests were written first.

Release 1.0 - Stage1:
---------------------
- Goes through numbers 1 to 100 and prints out either Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz
  or the number itself. 
	- Fizz if the number is divisible by three
	- Buzz if the number is divisible by five
	- FizzBuzz if both of the above
	- Number itself if neither Fizz or Buzz

Release 2.0 - Stage2 - new requirements
- As release 1.0 but now also checks if the given number contains 3 or 5.
  Result is the same as in v1.0 with these additions
	- Fizz if the number contains "3"
	- Buzz if the number contains "5"
	- FizzBuzz if both of the above
- A number can be given in command line, if nothing is given numbers
  1-100 are evaluated
